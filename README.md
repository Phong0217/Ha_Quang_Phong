# Step Counting Project with STM32 and MPU6050

## Introduction
This project is an implementation of a step counting system using the STM32 microcontroller and the MPU6050 accelerometer and gyroscope sensor. The system tracks and counts the number of steps taken by a person based on the sensor data.

## Components
- **STM32 Microcontroller:** The main processing unit responsible for reading data from the MPU6050 and processing step count algorithms.
- **MPU6050 Sensor:** An accelerometer and gyroscope sensor that provides motion data, used to detect steps.

## Features
1. **Step Detection:** Utilizes data from the MPU6050 sensor to detect and count steps.
2. **Real-time Monitoring:** Provides real-time monitoring of step count.
3. **Low Power Consumption:** Optimized for low power consumption to extend battery life.

## Hardware Setup
1. Connect the MPU6050 sensor to the STM32 microcontroller.
2. Power the system using a suitable power source.

## Software Setup
1. Install the necessary development environment for STM32.
2. Flash the code onto the STM32 microcontroller.

### Usage
Set up the hardware and software as per the provided instructions.
Run the system, and it will start monitoring and counting steps.
Retrieve step count data as needed.
